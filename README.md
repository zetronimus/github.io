# Hi, I'm Zetron,

I'm a cybersecurity professional with over 8 years of experience in threat detection, incident response, cloud security, and security operations. I specialize in building and tuning detections, leading incident investigations, and designing secure environments across Azure and AWS.

## My Focus Areas

- **Incident Response** – Performing rapid triage, containment, and recovery for security incidents across hybrid environments
- **Threat Hunting** – Developing proactive detection logic based on MITRE ATT&CK and current threat intel
- **Cloud Security** – Securing Azure and AWS infrastructure, identity, and workload configurations
- **EDR & SIEM Operations** – Deep hands-on work with tools like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Splunk, and Microsoft Sentinel
- **Security Automation** – Writing detection rules, scripts, and playbooks to streamline SOC processes
- **Frameworks** – Strong knowledge of NIST, CIS Benchmarks, SOC 2, and MITRE ATT&CK
